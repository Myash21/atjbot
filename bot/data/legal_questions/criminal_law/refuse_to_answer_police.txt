Legal Rights During Police Interrogations in India
Right to Know the Reasons for Arrest
The Right to Be Informed

When arrested, you have the right to be informed of the reasons for your arrest and the charges against you. This is not just a formality; itâ€™s a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian Constitution and various laws.
Right to Legal Representation
Access to a Lawyer

One of the most critical rights during interrogation is the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of your choice. This means you can ask for a lawyer immediately upon being detained or during questioning.
Right Against Self-Incrimination
Protection from Compulsory Self-Incrimination

The Constitution of India protects individuals from being compelled to testify against themselves. This means you cannot be forced to answer questions that might incriminate you.
Right to Silence
Choosing Not to Speak

Closely related to the right against self-incrimination is the right to silence. You are not obligated to answer any questions, especially if they could lead to self-incrimination.
Right to Be Presented Before a Magistrate Within 24 Hours
Timely Judicial Review

After arrest, you must be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours. This safeguard prevents illegal detention and ensures judicial oversight of the arrest process.
Right to Free Legal Aid
Assistance for the Underprivileged

If you cannot afford legal representation, the state is obligated to provide you with free legal aid. This right ensures that justice is accessible to all, regardless of financial status.
Right to Medical Examination
Ensuring Physical Well-being

During detention, you have the right to request a medical examination if you believe you have been mistreated. This examination must be conducted by a government doctor.
