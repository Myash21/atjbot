Lawyers use different fee structures based on the nature of the case and the client’s preferences.

Their rate will depend on their experience and reputation, the complexity of the case, and their location (big city lawyers charge more).

Here’s how lawyers might charge in India:
Pay-as-you-go: I prefer the pay-as-you-go fee structure, where you pay based on the tasks undertaken. Your lawyer will provide you with a list of tasks and their prices. This arrangement, solidified with a legal services agreement, safeguards the parties.

Hourly rate: This is the most common fee arrangement where the lawyer charges a set amount per hour. The rates can vary based on the lawyer’s experience and expertise. In India, hourly rates range from ₹1,000 to ₹30,000 or more.

Fixed fee: For certain types of legal work, such as drafting a will or handling a straightforward property transaction, lawyers might charge a fixed fee. This provides clarity and predictability regarding costs.

Retainer fee: This involves paying an upfront fee to secure the lawyer’s services. The retainer fee is usually held in a special account, and the lawyer bills against this amount as work is performed.

Contingency fee: In some cases, particularly in personal injury claims, lawyers may work on a contingency fee basis, meaning they only get paid if you win the case. The fee is typically a percentage of the settlement amount.
