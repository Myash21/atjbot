Championing the cause of safety and security of women and girl child, the Government provided for stringent punishment including death penalty for perpetrators of rape by passing the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018. Incidents of sexual offences and prolonged trials of accused necessitated dedicated court machinery to provide immediate relief to the victims. Since October 2019, the Department of Justice is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, to set up Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) including exclusive POCSO Courts across the nation for expeditious trial relating to sexual offences. Each court comprises of 1 Judicial Officer and 7 Staff Members. Out of 31 States and UTs eligible, 30 have joined this scheme. Puducherry made a special request to join the Scheme and the one exclusive POCSO Court was operationalized in May, 2023.

The Scheme was initially for a period of one year spread over two Financial Years 2019-20 and 2020-21 at a total outlay of Rs. 767.25 Cr. with Rs. 474 Cr. as Central Share to be met from Nirbhaya Fund. The Cabinet approved the continuation of the Scheme for two years i.e. up to March, 2023 with a total budgetary outlay of Rs. 1572.86 Cr. with Rs.971.70 Cr. as central share. The Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 28.11.2023 has further extended the Scheme for another three years â€“ from 01.04.2023 to 31.03.2026, at a total financial outlay of Rs. 1952.23 Cr. including Rs. 1207.24 Cr. as Central Share to be incurred from Nirbhaya Fund.

In F.Y. 2019-20, Rs. 140 Cr, in F.Y. 2020-21 Rs.160.00 Cr, in F.Y. 2021-22, Rs.134.56 Cr, in F.Y. 2022-23, Rs. 200.00 Cr and in the F.Y. 2023-24, Rs. 200.00 Cr. was released to States/UTs as Central Share.

As on May 2024, 755 FTSCs including 410 exclusive POCSO (ePOCSO) Courts are functional in 30 States / UTs which have disposed of more than 2,53,000 pending cases. In the current F.Y 2024-25, a total of Rs. 200.00 Cr. has been allocated.

For the robust implementation of the Scheme, this Department has created an online monitoring framework for monthly monitoring of case statistics. Regular review meetings with the Registrar Generals of High Courts and State functionaries are being undertaken.
