Setting up of Fast Track Courts (FTCs) and its functioning lies within the domain of State Governments in consultation with the respective High Courts. The 14th Finance Commission had recommended the setting up of 1800 FTCs during 2015-20 dealing with cases of heinous crimes; civil cases related to women, children, senior citizens, HIV/AIDS etc. and property related cases pending for more than 5 years. The Commission also urged State Governments to utilize enhanced fiscal space available through tax devolution (32% to 42%) for this purpose. 866 FTCs are functional across the country (May, 2024).
