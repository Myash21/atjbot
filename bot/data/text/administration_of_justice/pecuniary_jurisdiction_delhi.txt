Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi had received a request for enhancement of original pecuniary jurisdiction of District Courts of Delhi from the existing Rs. 20 lakh to Rs. 2 crore from the Coordination Committee of All Bar Associations of Delhi.

Government of National Capital Territory considered this request and observed that increasing the pecuniary jurisdiction would lessen the burden on High Court and there would be substantive improvement in disposal of cases in subordinate courts, since number of subordinate Courts has now increased due to creation of eleven Districts in Delhi.  Enhancement of pecuniary jurisdiction of Delhi District Courts will facilitate access of general public to the District Courts within the vicinity of their location.  Moreover, this would also be helpful to litigants in providing “Justice at Doorstep” due to the location of District Courts in different parts of Delhi.

The proposal received from the Govt. of NCT of Delhi seeking amendments in the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 to provide for enhancing the pecuniary limits of the District Courts of Delhi from the existing Rs.20 lakhs to Rs.2 crore was examined and a Bill viz., The Delhi High Court (Amendment) Bill, 2015 was introduced in the Parliament. The said Bill was considered and passed by both the Houses of Parliament. The Bill received the assent of the President President of India on 10.08.2015 and has been brought into force w.e.f.26.10.2015.

Increasing the pecuniary jurisdiction of district Courts of Delhi would lessen the burden of Delhi High Court and there would be substantive improvement in disposal of cases in subordinate Courts. This will facilitate access of the general public to 11 District Courts located in 6 District Court Complexes within the vicinity of their location, ensuring speedy justice to the litigants at their door steps.
