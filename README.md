## Overview

This project implements a chat support application using React for the frontend and a Flask backend that processes queries using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Users can select a language, send messages, and receive responses from a chatbot powered by machine learning. The application supports multiple document types and stores relevant data using Chroma as the database.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Users can interact with a chatbot that responds to queries.
- **Language Selection**: Supports multiple languages, allowing users to receive answers in their preferred language.
- **Dynamic Suggestions**: Provides predefined suggestions to enhance user experience.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Utilizes a RAG pipeline to fetch and process relevant documents and generate responses.
- **Link Extraction**: Extracts URLs from the context for users to reference.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting on API requests to ensure fair use.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: Chroma
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, LangChain, Google Generative AI
- **Document Loaders**: Supports PDF, CSV, and text files
- **Deployment**: Docker (if applicable)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for the React frontend)
- Python 3.7 or higher (for the Flask backend)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Setup Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your Google API key:

   ```bash
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

2. Select a language from the dropdown.
3. Type your query in the input box and press the send button.
4. View the chatbot's response along with any relevant links provided.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /**: Returns the main page (frontend).
- **POST /predict**: Accepts a JSON request with a `message` field to generate a response based on the provided query.
